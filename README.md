# Backwards ABC Learning App

Note: completely vibe coded via cursor. I love technology

A simple, minimal React application for learning the alphabet backwards. Start from Z and work your way to A!

## Features

- **Backwards Learning**: Start at Z and progress through the alphabet backwards
- **Spacebar Navigation**: Press the spacebar to advance to the next letter
- **One Letter at a Time**: Each letter is displayed prominently in the center
- **Progress Tracking**: See your current position (e.g., "5 of 26")
- **Completion Screen**: Congratulations message when you finish
- **Keyboard-Only Experience**: Complete the entire alphabet without touching your mouse
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Use

1. **Start**: The app begins with the letter "Z"
2. **Navigate**: Press the spacebar to advance to the next letter (Y, X, W, etc.)
3. **Track Progress**: Watch the progress counter at the bottom
4. **Complete**: When you reach "A", you'll see a congratulations screen
5. **Restart**: Press spacebar or click "Start Over" to begin again
